<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Aliyah Pargan! I am currently a 16 year old junior in high school who is studying web and app development. Throughout my experience so far, I have learned to design and develop webpages, websites, apps and video games!
      I have much experience with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I am currently learning more about python. I look foward to creating a lot more fun and interactive websites and apps, and developing my skills along the way, bringing me closer to my 
      goal of becoming a web developer and software engineer. </p>
